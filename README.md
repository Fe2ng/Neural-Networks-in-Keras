# Neural-Networks-in-Keras
The examples in this notebook assume that you are familiar with the theory of the neural networks. To learn more about the neural networks, you can refer resources below. I used I used Theano as the backend. To use Tensorflow, refer the link for installation instructions below.

## Resources:
* Michael Nielsen's book on [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
* [Article on Deep Learning](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/mishra/COURSES/15.Summer/lecun2015.pdf) by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton
* Christopher Olah's [blog](http://colah.github.io/)
* Videos from [Bay Area Deep Learning School](http://www.bayareadlschool.org/): [Day1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyovmAtoUx0), [Day2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dXiAecyJrY)

## Installation Instructions
Refer the [README](https://github.com/lgraesser/Neural-Networks-Workshop-Materials-WiMLDS) on Laura Graesser's Github repository.
